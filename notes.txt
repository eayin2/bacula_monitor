 data structure:
 { a : { b : [1, 2, 3],
         c : [4, 5, 6],

       },
  aa : { bb : [11, 22, 33],
         cc : [44, 55, 66]
       }
 }
 - no need to show type because pool name implies type
 - no need to show 'T' for successful job, because only T is retrieved.
 - no need to show/select full or inc type either, bcs pool name implies it too.
